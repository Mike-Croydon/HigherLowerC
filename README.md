# HigherLowerC
Simple game that guesses the user's number.
Current implementation is similar to an interval bisection method to find zero of a function.
Each new guess is the average of the previous Higher and Lower guess, which are initialized at 100 and 0
Future steps to take would be cleaning up repetitive code with better loops and more functions, as well as trying out different algorithms to solve
